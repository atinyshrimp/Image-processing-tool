#### An image processing tool written in C# as a project for my 2nd year of engineering school.
<br>

This project was given to us, engineering students, as an end of semester project to gauge what we had learnt in our Object-Oriented Programming class. The image processing tool can be used to:
* Apply filters to pictures with convolution matrices
* Rotate, mirror, resize images
* Generate histograms for a picture
* Hide an image within another (steganography)
* Generate a QR Code (v1 & v2) from a sentence

```diff
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è All of these only work with Bitmap images (.bmp) ‚ÄºÔ∏è -
```

## Watch how it works

1. Open a Bitmap image to work with

2. Choose an action to apply to the picture ; here, there is a hidden image so I'll try to decode it

3. Take a look at the generated result

4. Save the picture (or not üòÖ)

Basically, open an image and click on the button that fits what you want to do the most
